# Commit Rules

- Follow conventional commits: `type: description` (max 72 chars)
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert
- No scope (e.g. `feat: add offline mode`, NOT `feat(proxy): add offline mode`)
- No body, no footer
- No co-authorship notes
- Group related changes into separate commits by type
